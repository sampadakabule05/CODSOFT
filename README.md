# Credit Card Fraud Detection â€“ CodSoft

## Objective
Build a classification model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using transaction features.

## Dataset
- **Source:** creditcard.csv (Kaggle)
- **Features:** Time, Amount, V1-V28 (anonymised principal components)
- **Target:** Class (0 = Not Fraud, 1 = Fraud)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Steps Performed
1. Imported required libraries.
2. Loaded the credit card dataset.
3. Explored dataset structure and checked class distribution (imbalanced).
4. Split data into features and target variable.
5. Performed train-test split (80-20).
6. Trained a Random Forest Classifier.
7. Made predictions on test data.
8. Evaluated model performance using:
   - Accuracy Score
   - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
   - Confusion Matrix
9. Predicted fraud status for a sample transaction input.

## Results
- **Accuracy:** [Your Output]
- The model effectively classifies transactions as fraudulent or not, though precision and recall are more important due to class imbalance.

## Sample Prediction
- **Input:** First row from test dataset
- **Output:** Predicted class (1 = Fraud, 0 = Not Fraud)

## Files
