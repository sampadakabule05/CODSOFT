# Sales Prediction â€“ CodSoft

## Objective
Build a regression model to predict sales revenue based on advertising budget data.

## Dataset
The dataset contains:
- Advertising budget (e.g., TV, radio, newspaper)
- Sales revenue

(Note: Replace with your specific dataset details if different.)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (if used for visualization)

## Steps Performed
1. Imported required libraries.
2. Loaded the sales dataset.
3. Performed data exploration and preprocessing.
4. Split data into features (advertising budget columns) and target (sales).
5. Split data into training and testing sets.
6. Trained a Linear Regression model.
7. Made predictions on the test set.
8. Evaluated model performance using:
   - R2 Score
   - Mean Squared Error
9. Predicted sales for a sample advertising budget input.

## Results
- R2 Score: [Your Output]
- Mean Squared Error: [Your Output]

## Files
- sales_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with complete code and outputs.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download files.
2. Install required packages:
    ```
    pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
    ```
3. Open `sales_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab and run all cells.
